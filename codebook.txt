Step 1. The test and train datasets are combined
Test data is from the test directory
- X_test.txt for the variables
- y_test.txt for the activity where:
- subject_info.txt for the subject id

Train data is taken from the train directory
- X_train.txt
- y_train.txt
- subject_info.txt for the subject id

Step 2. Extract the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
The name for each variable is found in features.txt and a regular expression is used to find the features that have mean or std in their name

Step 3: Use descriptive activity names
The activity label is transformed from an integer to a character string by using activity_labels.txt such that
	1 = WALKING
	2 = WALKING_UPSTAIRS
	3 = WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
	4 = SITTING
	5 = STANDING
	6 = LAYING

Step 4: Use descriptive variable names
The names are set to be their given names from features.txt

Step 5: Create a second dataset with average of each variable for each activity and each subject
The dataset from step 4 is grouped by activity and subject_id and the means are calculated using the aggregate function
write.table(avg_data, 'tidy_dataset.txt', row.names=FALSE)
